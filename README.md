# Interpreter
System that serves as interpreter.lexer, interpreter.parser and interprete.interpreter of a subset of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). 
It reads code written in that language, creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and is able to execute the result. 
For this, it includes the syntactic and semantic validation, as well as indicates the position (row and column) of the errors.

## Modularization
The system is composed of three components: Lexer, Parser and Interpreter. The interpreter.lexer is responsible for generating tokens
based on the code, that is, it reads the characters that make up the code and groups them in tokens. The interpreter.parser creates a 
specific AST for this language based on the tokens generated by the interpreter.lexer, this tree represents all the information that 
exists in the code, to then allow its execution. The interprete.interpreter reads the AST and executes, with it, each one of the 
sentences of the code. Each of the components or modules of the system has a defined interface that allows it to be used 
by other components. When one component is used by another, it only access through the defined interface.

## Definitions
A interpreter.lexer is a software program that performs lexical analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of separating a stream of 
characters into different words, which are called 'tokens' .

Parsing means to make something understandable. This is done by partially analysing the data, 
understanding its underlying structure (by making some assumptions based on what you're expecting to see), and converting 
the information represented in one form into another one.

An interprete.interpreter is a program that can analyse and execute a program line by line. It directly executes instructions written 
in a programming language, without requiring previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

## Language
The language that is interpreted is a subset of TypeScript that is limited to:
* Declaration of variables
  * Only variables with the keyword "let"
  * Without type differences, it is necessary to clarify the variable type ("let x: number; ")
  * Only one variable can be declared per sentence
  * You can declare and assign a value in the same sentence
* Assignment of variables already declared ("x = 5")
* Support only of two basic types: "number" and "string"
* Strings can be declared with single or double quotes ("o ')
* All statements must be terminated with ";"
* Variables and literals of type "number" must support arithmetic operations:
  * Sum
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Type "number" includes integers and decimals. Concatenation of variables and literals of type "string"
  * With the "+" symbol
  * This includes the concatenation of "string" and "number", if the expression includes both types the result is "string"
* An expression that does not belong to TypeScript to print values, its syntax is equivalent to a function named "print" 
in TypeScript. This "function" of printing receives as an argument an expression of type "string" or "number", it prints 
its value to the console together with a line break "

## Purpose
This project represents the practical work number 4 for the course of System Engineering 2019, at Austral University.
